      "Beispiel 1: after drafting a post in Google Docs I\ncan either copy and paste this text over\nto a standalone app like chbt to improve\nmy writing or I can use the built-in or\nintegrated Gemini for workspace AI\nfeature to make adjustments another\nexample would be I can either use mid\nJourney as a standalone tool to generate\nimages for a presentation or I can\ncreate an image directly within Google\nSlides by using again gemni for\nworkspace in these instances chbt and M\nJourney are Standalone AI tools and\nGoogle Docs and Google slides are tools\nwith integrated AI features third a\ncustom AI solution is an application\nthat's tailor made to solve a specific\nproblem for instance John Hopkins\nUniversity developed an AI system with\nthe sole objective of detecting sepsis\nthis custom AI solution improved\ndiagnostic accuracy from 2 to 5% to an\naverage of 40% and if you're like me and\nhave no technical background you might\nthink oh custom AI Solutions are\nextremely Technical and I'll probably\nnever have to use them in the workplace\nin reality the opposite is true because\nwell-designed custom AI Solutions should\nrequire little to no technical knoow for\nexample when I was in the sales team I\nmanaged over 200 clients every quarter\nand Performing research on every single\none was obviously timec consuming\nnowadays there are custom AI solutions\nthat can ingest all the information\nabout those 200 clients taking into\naccount factors like seasonality\nhistorical data and Industry Trends and\nrank those clients by How likely they\nare to need assistance helping the\nsalesperson prioritize their time by the\nway if you're thinking of buying\nGoogle's AI Essentials course don't\nbecause I only found out after I paid\nfor it you get the AI Essentials course\nfor free if you enroll in the Google\nproject management certification on\ncorsera who is kindly sponsoring this\nportion of the video regular viewers\nknow that I have a full-time job and\nproject management obviously plays a\nlarge part in my day-to-day to be\ntransparent though I'm mainly\nself-taught since there wasn't a go-to\ncourse back in the day but I recently\nstarted the project management\ncertification on corsera since it's now\nlike the golden standard for project\nmanagement project management is\nliterally applicable to all Industries\nand roles so if you want to be more\norganized in the workplace click the\nlink below to enroll in the Google\nproject management certification and\nunlock the AI Essentials course for free\nthank you corsera for sponsoring this\npart of the video back to my takeaways\nthe second learning from the course is a\nprompt engineering tip and it's to\nsurface the implied context to\nillustrate this imagine your vegetarian\nfriend asks you for restaurant\nrecommendations you instinctively reply\nwith vegetarian friendly options even if\nyour friend doesn't explicitly say hey\nidiot make sure it's vegetarian here\nhere the fact that your friend is a\nvegetarian is implied context and needs\nto be explicitly stated when\ncommunicating with AI tools like Chachi\nBT and Google Gemini another example\nmight be you're preparing to negotiate a\nraise with your boss you know in your\nhead that last year you received a 10%\nincrease this year you're the highest\nperformer on the team and the industry\naverage is a 12% increase so you decide\nto ask for 15% raise If You Leave Out\nAll That implied context when\nbrainstorming negotiation techniques\nwith an AI tool you will receive a lower\nquality AKA more generic output if you\nwant to dive deeper into this I have an\nentire video on how to write the perfect\nprompt so I'll leave a link to that down\nbelow and if you want to make a copy of\nmy five favorite prompts for\nproductivity I'll leave a link to my\ncompletely free workspace toolkit as\nwell takeaway number three know when to\nuse zero shot and few shot prompting in\na nutshell the word shot simply means\nexamples zero shot means you use a\nprompt with no examples one shot means\nyou include one example few shot means\nyou include two or more examples for\ninstance a zero shot example might look\nsomething like write me a pickup line\nfor Bumble which is a completely\nhypothetical scenario I would never\ncondone much less participate in a\none-hot prompt would be write me a\npickup line for Bumble reference this\npickup line my friend used that worked\nwell for him and you include an example\nof what your friend wrote A F shop\nprompt would look the same as one shot\nwith just two or more examples of\nsuccessful pickup lines and as you can\nimagine the more relevant examples you\nprovide the AI tool the more relevant\nthe output and for the record if my H\nfuture wife is watching this I've\nobviously never done this myself this is\njust an example for this video as a\nmatter of fact I don't I don't even use\ndating apps takeaway number four use\nChain of Thought prompting for complex\ntasks I've talked about this concept in\nprevious videos but I really like this\nsimple and straightforward definition\nfrom Google's course when you divide a\nsingle task into more manageable steps\nyou help the large language model\nproduce accurate and consistent results\na relatable real word example would be\nwriting a cover letter option one you\nshare your current resume and the job\ndescription with the chatbot and just\nprompt it to write you a cover letter\noption two with Chain of Thought\nprompting you break the large task\nwriting an entire cover letter into\nmanageable steps with step one being\nbased on my resume and the job\ndescription write an attention Gra\nhaving hook for my cover letter then\nafter making some minor tweaks to the\nhook paragraph step two would be pasting\nthat back into the chatbot and asking it\nfor the body paragraph rinse and repeat\nfor the closing paragraph if you want\nproof that this works I have an entire\nvideo where I show job Seekers how to\nuse Chain of Thought prompting to not\nonly write cover letters but to also\nimprove their resumés I'll leave a link\ndown below takeaway number five is a\ntopic that many of us including myself\ntend to overlook when using AI tools and\nit's to understand the limitations of AI\nbroadly speaking there are three main\nlimitations first the underlying data\nthat is used to train AI models may be\nbiased if a text to image model is only\ntrained on minimalistic Graphics it\nmight not be able to produce flashy and\nbold designs second there simply wasn't\nenough information in the source\ntraining data on a given topic many AI\nmodels have a cutoff date so if you ask\nfor something that happened recently it\nwon't have enough data on that topic to\ngive you an accurate accurate answer\nfinally hallucinations are AI outputs\nthat are straight up factually\ninaccurate sometimes this is a feature\nand not a bug when you're brainstorming\nnew ideas for example other times\nhallucinations perpetuate false\ninformation so you definitely want to\ndouble check your answer for what I call\nhigh stake tasks for example what sort\nof supplement or vitamin to take given\nyour health goals when it comes to pros\nand cons I'm going to start with who\nthis course is not for this course is\nnot for you if you're already using AI\ntools like chpt and Google Gemini as\npart of your daily workflow and you're\nlooking to dive deeper into specific AI\nuse cases and that's because although\nthey do a great job explaining complex\ntopics the examples they give in the\ncourse are pretty vague for instance in\none of the lessons they gave an example\nwhere a company uses AI to decrease\ncustomer service response times and that\nwas it that was entire example it would\nhave been nice to dive a bit deeper and\ntalk about whether this company used a\nstandalone AI tool or custom AI solution\nhow they trained the workers to use the\nAI system how they grounded the data so\nthat the AI system didn't hallucinate\nsince this was a customer service um\napplication right so stuff like that\nthat being said this is an excellent\nbeginner level course with three huge\nadvantages first you're learning from\nGoogle employees who are established\nexperts in the field of AI they know\nwhat they're talking about and they're\nnot just some random person on the\ninternet who enjoys making crass jokes\nsecond as a visual learner I'm amazed at\nhow they're able to use Simple Graphics\nto explain complex topics for example\nthey analogize AI tools and AI models to\na car and its engine the model sleng\nengine provides the underlying\ncapabilities while the tool like the car\nhelps you in completing the task third\nthe interactive elements are\nsurprisingly helpful the activities or\nhomework are well-designed in that they\nactually help you learn a key concept\nfrom that lesson the graded assignments\nare also not that easy they're mainly\nmultiple choice but you actually have to\npay attention to get 80% and pass the\nquiz last but not least the course\nprovides a curated list of AI tools for\nbeginners to explore and includes a\nglossery of common AI terms that are now\nprevalent in our daily lives to sum up\nthis course is great for beginners\nvisual Learners and can use the legit\ncertificate you get the end to attract\nprospective employers and or Partners um\nif you this video helpful you might want\nto check out my summary of Google's free\nAI course that's a bit more conceptual\nbut equally important in the meantime\nthough as\nusual have a great one"

    "title": "Der 50% of my AI workload\nbecause when compared to other general\npurpose chat Bots like chbt and Google\nGemini CLA excels at three specific\ntypes of tasks so in this video I'll\nshow you exactly how to set up Cloud for\nmaximum performance cover its most\nimpactful features and of course dive\ninto real world use cases let's get\nstarted first up we're going right into\nsettings and under the profile tab you\ncan see that I've intentionally left the\npersonal preferences section here blank\nthis is claw's equivalent of chat PT's\ncustom instructions why because unlike\nchat PT I find that claud's default\noutput is already well structured and\nconcise for example I have custom\ninstructions for Chach BT to structure\noutputs like a consultant but Claude\ndoesn't need this kind of handholding\nand this is also one of the reasons I\nprefer Claude over chat jbt and Gemini\nfor writing tasks next go ahead and\nenable artifacts and CSV chat\nsuggestions but disable prompt examples\nthese are just two basic and clutter up\nyour workspace and if you're on the paid\nplan I highly recommend connecting your\nGoogle Drive and you'll see all of this\nin action in a little bit and under\nfeature preview toggling on the analysis\ntool allows Claude to analyze and\nvisualize data again you'll see examples\nof this later on and I keep latex\nrendering off because I don't use clod\nfor Math and someone the comments please\nconfirm this is indeed pronounced latex\nnow the foundation is set up let's move\non to feature number one artifacts\ndiving right into an example here I'm\nasking Claude to draft an external blog\npost based on a product design document\nand notice how Claude opens up a\nseparate window to present the final\nblog post while explaining its thought\nprocess in the original chat thread put\nsimply the artifacts feature this\nStandalone window on the right makes it\neasy for us to work with complex output\ninstead of having to copy text from the\nchat box and paste it somewhere and\nhaving to remove this extra information\nright I could just copy the entire blog\npost here or download a plain text file\nand that's not all after adding a\nfollow-up prompt asking for a tweak to\nthe first paragraph we can see Claude\nmaking real time edits directly in the\nartifacts window giving us the peace of\nmind that nothing else has been changed\nin addition to text Claud can also\noutput code and charts in the artifacts\nwindow check this out here I'm asking\nClaude to write a Google app script that\nformats all speaker notes from a Google\nSlides presentation and although I have\nno coding background I just follow the\nsteps copy and paste the code let it run\nand wow it works perfectly for the\ncharts example I'm going to kill two\nbirds with one stone and first show you\nhow we can click the screenshot button\nhere to grab a screen capture from\nanother tab or window in this case I'm\nsharing an event registration funnel\nregistered to approved to attended\nand I asked Claude to create a funnel\nthat visualizes the attendees for this\nevent share key findings below the graph\nand after letting that run oops we ran\ninto an error thank god this is my\ndesign and I totally plann for this no\nbut seriously I did um what's amazing is\nthat we can ask Claud to fix its own\nerror and after a few seconds CLA\nsuccessfully troubleshoots and outputs a\nchart and even adds a few calculations\nbelow don't worry we'll go through much\nmore Advanced Data visualization\nexamples later but for now just remember\nClaude gets to determine when to use the\nartifacts window meaning sometimes if\nyour task is too simple the text or code\noutput might just appear within the chat\nbox next up we have writing styles when\nwe start a new chat we can choose from a\nfew preset writing styles and after\ntrying these out I can tell you for 99%\nof the time normal works just fine\nthere's no need to waste time and add\nunnecessary friction switching back and\nforth I've also found the create my own\nstyle function to be slightly\ndisappointing the idea is to share a few\nparagraphs of example writing and Claude\nwill remember and mimic that style for\nexample I love watching fireships videos\nhis name is also Jeff by the way my name\nis Jeff he has this very sharp sarcastic\nand self-deprecating sense of humor but\neven after sharing transcripts from\nmultiple videos claude's attempt at\nemulating his tone of voice is not just\nunderwhelming but arguably inaccurate by\nthe way if keeping up with AI is one of\nyour goals for this year you can grab my\nfree AI toolkit designed to cut through\nthe noise and help you master essential\nAI tools and workflows I'll leave a link\ndown below although this next feature\nisn't exclusive to Claw is my favorite\none by far projects starting with a\nsimple visualization of how it works\nlet's say I find a workout program I\nlike online I can share that as context\nwith Claude along with my fitness goals\nand ask claw to generate a tailored plan\nfor me simple but what if my girlfriend\nalso wants a workout plan tailored for\nher instead of adding herles into the\nsame chat thread and risk confusing the\nAI as the conversation progresses it's\nmuch better to add the workout routine I\nfound as project level context and\nwithin that project create two separate\nchats with chat level context one with\nmy fitness goals and one with that of my\ngirlfriends putting aside the most\nhypothetical part of this example is me\nfinding a girlfriend just think about\nhow much time this feature can save you\nat work for example as a product\nmarketing manager one of my\nresponsibilities is communicating\nproduct announcements so at the project\nlevel within Claude I attach a comto a\nproduct overview document written by the\nproduct team and at the chat level I\nshare newsletters from previous product\nannouncements now that we have project\nlevel context the coms do and chat level\ncontext EX examples of previous\nnewsletters I can ask claw to write a\nnewsletter for this latest launch using\nthe same format structure and tone found\nin the previous newsletters taking this\na step further by sharing previous blog\nposts internal announcements and PR\nbriefings at the chat level while\nkeeping the coms do as project level\ncontext we can quickly generate tailored\noutputs that maintain perfect\nconsistency with our new product\nmessaging the results are amazing try\nyourself yes I still need to go in and\nmake some minor adjustment to the\noutputs but with the right prompts this\ngets me 80% of the weight there a few\nthings to keep in mind when using the\nprojects feature first although we can\nadd text content at the project level we\ncannot at the chat level second I like\nto add project level custom instructions\nsince we're announcing a new product\nlauncher I'm telling Claud to highlight\nthe products unique benefits and how\nthey solve potential consumer pain\npoints and for let's say my own YouTube\nprojects I instruct CL to act like a\nsenior YouTube strategist who's\nexperienced at storytelling finally\nprojects is a paid feature so if you can\nonly pay for one AI tool out say stick\nwith chat BT or Google Gemini since they\nare more well-rounded and chat BT has\nthe projects feature anyways um and only\npay for Claude if your job involves a\nlot of writing and or coding moving on\nto interactive dashboards here I have\nthe latest AI agents white paper\npublished by Google but it's too long I\ndon't have a technical background and I\njust want to know the key Concepts so I\nattach it to a chat and ask Claude to\ncreate an interactive dashboard to\nvisualize this dense PDF so I can digest\nthe information more easily Claude opens\nup the artifacts window and starts\ngenerating the code to produce the\ndashboard and oops it ran into another\nbug no problem though we tell claw to\ntake care of it and after a few moments\nit outputs a fully functional dashboard\nbut as you can see the user interface is\na bit awkward so I tell Claude hey the\nlayout is a bit weird let's have the\ntabs go across horizontally and the\ncorresponding content only appear when I\nclick on a tab and after a few more\nmoments Claud makes the changes so that\nonly the active tabs contents are shown\nlet's first take a moment to acknowledge\nhow mind-blowing that was not only did\nClaude generate a fully functional\ndashboard without us writing any code it\nalso fixed its own errors and made edits\nto the initial dashboard Pro tip make\nsure to include the key keyword\ninteractive in your prompt when creating\ninteractive elements like interactive\nfunnel or interactive charts taking this\nexample a step further I asked Claude to\ncreate a simple infographic that\nsummarizes the white paper so that I can\nshare bite-sized visuals on social media\nand get that sweet sweet engagement\nafter Claude does its thing I guess this\nis technically an infographic but still\nvery hard to understand the relationship\nbetween these key Concepts right so I\ncan add a follow-up prompt uh let's show\nthe relationship and connections between\nthe key Concepts in a more userfriendly\nway and use a black and orange color\nscheme and after Claude reruns the code\nthis is much much better uh it's a lot\ncleaner yes there's still issues like\nspacing issues and the arrows are on top\nof the text here but that's okay because\nI just wanted a visual mockup of how an\ninfographic would look and now I can\ndownload this as a SVG file and start\nmaking edits myself now let's talk about\ndata visualization earlier on we created\na simple funnel chart based on\ninformation from a spreadsheet but you\nmight be like Jeff this data is so clean\nit's organized it's in a table I'm\nusually working with unstructured Messy\ndata no problem I have a set of messy\ntransaction data right here and instead\nof me telling you what we're looking at\nlet's ask Claude we'll first download\nthis as a CSV file and we're going to\nupload that onto Claud with this prompt\nact as a senior business analyst blah\nblah blah your task is to analyze the\nprovided data and Outline Three\neffective methods or Frameworks for\nderiving meaningful insights and here\nwhen Claud is quote unquote thinking we\ncan see the analysis feature we enabled\nearlier Claude first analyzes the data\nwhich is great because we didn't share\nany context then Claud tells us what\ninsights we can extract based on its\nanalysis of the raw data I'm not going\nto read through all of this but one\nthing that caught my IE was customer\nsegmentation and since I know that all\nthese transactions come from two sources\ngumroad and subscription I can follow up\nwith this prompt I like to segment the\ncustomers based on purchase patterns\nspecifically I want you to bucket the\npurchases under gumroad or subscriptions\ncreate a visualization and add key\nfindings under the charts and after\naround 20 seconds of thinking and coding\nClaude outputs a bar chart comparing the\ntwo types of transactions and below the\nchart we're told subscriptions made up\n56% of transactions compared to gum\nRoad's 44% yet despite fewer\ntransactions gumroad generated higher\nRevenue I'm a cynical person so just to\nbe safe I go back to the raw data filter\nfor all the subscription transactions\nand I'm just going to sum all this up\nand we see that it's\n$2,862 and going back to our um Claud\noutput here subscriptions\n$2,862 so yeah it's accurate if I wanted\nto use this in a presentation at work\nI'd make some changes to the color\nscheme and font Styles right take a\nscreenshot of this chart here copy and\ninsert it within a slide like so and I\nwould copy the key findings and paste\nthose as Speaker notes Pro tip include\nthe word visualize or visualization if\nyou want claw to Output some sort of\nvisual element we went through a lot\ntoday so so to quickly recap first the\nprojects feature lets us manage context\nat both the project and chat level\nenabling us to generate highly tailored\ncontent while maintaining perfect\nconsistency second Claud excels at\nturning complex information into\ninteractive dashboards via its artifacts\nfeature and the best part is we're able\nto easily make adjustments even if we\ndon't know how to code and finally\nthanks to the analysis feature clot is\nable to visualize insights derived from\nunstructured data\nin ways that anyone can understand from\nsimple funnels to customer segmentation\nanalysis if you enjoyed this you might\nwant to check

chat\nsuggestions but disable prompt examples\nthese are just two basic and clutter up\nyour workspace and if you're on the paid\nplan I highly recommend connecting your\nGoogle Drive and you'll see all of this\nin action in a little bit and under\nfeature preview toggling on the analysis\ntool allows Claude to analyze and\nvisualize data again you'll see examples\nof this later on and I keep latex\nrendering off because I don't use clod\nfor Math and someone the comments please\nconfirm this is indeed pronounced latex\nnow the foundation is set up let's move\non to feature number one artifacts\ndiving right into an example here I'm\nasking Claude to draft an external blog\npost based on a product design document\nand notice how Claude opens up a\nseparate window to present the final\nblog post while explaining its thought\nprocess in the original chat thread put\nsimply the artifacts feature this\nStandalone window on the right makes it\neasy for us to work with complex output\ninstead of having to copy text from the\nchat box and paste it somewhere and\nhaving to remove this extra information\nright I could just copy the entire blog\npost here or download a plain text file\nand that's not all after adding a\nfollow-up prompt asking for a tweak to\nthe first paragraph we can see Claude\nmaking real time edits directly in the\nartifacts window giving us the peace of\nmind that nothing else has been changed\nin addition to text Claud can also\noutput code and charts in the artifacts\nwindow check this out here I'm asking\nClaude to write a Google app script that\nformats all speaker notes from a Google\nSlides presentation and although I have\nno coding background I just follow the\nsteps copy and paste the code let it run\nand wow it works perfectly for the\ncharts example I'm going to kill two\nbirds with one stone and first show you\nhow we can click the screenshot button\nhere to grab a screen capture from\nanother tab or window in this case I'm\nsharing an event registration funnel\nregistered to approved to attended\nand I asked Claude to create a funnel\nthat visualizes the attendees for this\nevent share key findings below the graph\nand after letting that run oops we ran\ninto an error thank god this is my\ndesign and I totally plann for this no\nbut seriously I did um what's amazing is\nthat we can ask Claud to fix its own\nerror and after a few seconds CLA\nsuccessfully troubleshoots and outputs a\nchart and even adds a few calculations\nbelow don't worry we'll go through much\nmore Advanced Data visualization\nexamples later but for now just remember\nClaude gets to determine when to use the\nartifacts window meaning sometimes if\nyour task is too simple the text or code\noutput might just appear within the chat\nbox next up we have writing styles when\nwe start a new chat we can choose from a\nfew preset writing styles and after\ntrying these out I can tell you for 99%\nof the time normal works just fine\nthere's no need to waste time and add\nunnecessary friction switching back and\nforth I've also found the create my own\nstyle function to be slightly\ndisappointing the idea is to share a few\nparagraphs of example writing and Claude\nwill remember and mimic that style for\nexample I love watching fireships videos\nhis name is also Jeff by the way my name\nis Jeff he has this very sharp sarcastic\nand self-deprecating sense of humor but\neven after sharing transcripts from\nmultiple videos claude's attempt at\nemulating his tone of voice is not just\nunderwhelming but arguably inaccurate by\nthe way if keeping up with AI is one of\nyour goals for this year you can grab my\nfree AI toolkit designed to cut through\nthe noise and help you master essential\nAI tools and workflows I'll leave a link\ndown below although this next feature\nisn't exclusive to Claw is my favorite\none by far projects starting with a\nsimple visualization of how it works\nlet's say I find a workout program I\nlike online I can share that as context\nwith Claude along with my fitness goals\nand ask claw to generate a tailored plan\nfor me simple but what if my girlfriend\nalso wants a workout plan tailored for\nher instead of adding herles into the\nsame chat thread and risk confusing the\nAI as the conversation progresses it's\nmuch better to add the workout routine I\nfound as project level context and\nwithin that project create two separate\nchats with chat level context one with\nmy fitness goals and one with that of my\ngirlfriends putting aside the most\nhypothetical part of this example is me\nfinding a girlfriend just think about\nhow much time this feature can save you\nat work for example as a product\nmarketing manager one of my\nresponsibilities is communicating\nproduct announcements so at the project\nlevel within Claude I attach a comto a\nproduct overview document written by the\nproduct team and at the chat level I\nshare newsletters from previous product\nannouncements now that we have project\nlevel context the coms do and chat level\ncontext EX examples of previous\nnewsletters I can ask claw to write a\nnewsletter for this latest launch using\nthe same format structure and tone found\nin the previous newsletters taking this\na step further by sharing previous blog\nposts internal announcements and PR\nbriefings at the chat level while\nkeeping the coms do as project level\ncontext we can quickly generate tailored\noutputs that maintain perfect\nconsistency with our new product\nmessaging the results are amazing try\nyourself yes I still need to go in and\nmake some minor adjustment to the\noutputs but with the right prompts this\ngets me 80% of the weight there a few\nthings to keep in mind when using the\nprojects feature first although we can\nadd text content at the project level we\ncannot at the chat level second I like\nto add project level custom instructions\nsince we're announcing a new product\nlauncher I'm telling Claud to highlight\nthe products unique benefits and how\nthey solve potential consumer pain\npoints and for let's say my own YouTube\nprojects I instruct CL to act like a\nsenior YouTube strategist who's\nexperienced at storytelling finally\nprojects is a paid feature so if you can\nonly pay for one AI tool out say stick\nwith chat BT or Google Gemini since they\nare more well-rounded and chat BT has\nthe projects feature anyways um and only\npay for Claude if your job involves a\nlot of writing and or coding moving on\nto interactive dashboards here I have\nthe latest AI agents white paper\npublished by Google but it's too long I\ndon't have a technical background and I\njust want to know the key Concepts so I\nattach it to a chat and ask Claude to\ncreate an interactive dashboard to\nvisualize this dense PDF so I can digest\nthe information more easily Claude opens\nup the artifacts window and starts\ngenerating the code to produce the\ndashboard and oops it ran into another\nbug no problem though we tell claw to\ntake care of it and after a few moments\nit outputs a fully functional dashboard\nbut as you can see the user interface is\na bit awkward so I tell Claude hey the\nlayout is a bit weird let's have the\ntabs go across horizontally and the\ncorresponding content only appear when I\nclick on a tab and after a few more\nmoments Claud makes the changes so that\nonly the active tabs contents are shown\nlet's first take a moment to acknowledge\nhow mind-blowing that was not only did\nClaude generate a fully functional\ndashboard without us writing any code it\nalso fixed its own errors and made edits\nto the initial dashboard Pro tip make\nsure to include the key keyword\ninteractive in your prompt when creating\ninteractive elements like interactive\nfunnel or interactive charts taking this\nexample a step further I asked Claude to\ncreate a simple infographic that\nsummarizes the white paper so that I can\nshare bite-sized visuals on social media\nand get that sweet sweet engagement\nafter Claude does its thing I guess this\nis technically an infographic but still\nvery hard to understand the relationship\nbetween these key Concepts right so I\ncan add a follow-up prompt uh let's show\nthe relationship and connections between\nthe key Concepts in a more userfriendly\nway and use a black and orange color\nscheme and after Claude reruns the code\nthis is much much better uh it's a lot\ncleaner yes there's still issues like\nspacing issues and the arrows are on top\nof the text here but that's okay because\nI just wanted a visual mockup of how an\ninfographic would look and now I can\ndownload this as a SVG file and start\nmaking edits myself now let's talk about\ndata visualization earlier on we created\na simple funnel chart based on\ninformation from a spreadsheet but you\nmight be like Jeff this data is so clean\nit's organized it's in a table I'm\nusually working with unstructured Messy\ndata no problem I have a set of messy\ntransaction data right here and instead\nof me telling you what we're looking at\nlet's ask Claude we'll first download\nthis as a CSV file and we're going to\nupload that onto Claud with this prompt\nact as a senior business analyst blah\nblah blah your task is to analyze the\nprovided data and Outline Three\neffective methods or Frameworks for\nderiving meaningful insights and here\nwhen Claud is quote unquote thinking we\ncan see the analysis feature we enabled\nearlier Claude first analyzes the data\nwhich is great because we didn't share\nany context then Claud tells us what\ninsights we can extract based on its\nanalysis of the raw data I'm not going\nto read through all of this but one\nthing that caught my IE was customer\nsegmentation and since I know that all\nthese transactions come from two sources\ngumroad and subscription I can follow up\nwith this prompt I like to segment the\ncustomers based on purchase patterns\nspecifically I want you to bucket the\npurchases under gumroad or subscriptions\ncreate a visualization and add key\nfindings under the charts and after\naround 20 seconds of thinking and coding\nClaude outputs a bar chart comparing the\ntwo types of transactions and below the\nchart we're told subscriptions made up\n56% of transactions compared to gum\nRoad's 44% yet despite fewer\ntransactions gumroad generated higher\nRevenue I'm a cynical person so just to\nbe safe I go back to the raw data filter\nfor all the subscription transactions\nand I'm just going to sum all this up\nand we see that it's\n$2,862 and going back to our um Claud\noutput here subscriptions\n$2,862 so yeah it's accurate if I wanted\nto use this in a presentation at work\nI'd make some changes to the color\nscheme and font Styles right take a\nscreenshot of this chart here copy and\ninsert it within a slide like so and I\nwould copy the key findings and paste\nthose as Speaker notes Pro tip include\nthe word visualize or visualization if\nyou want claw to Output some sort of\nvisual element we went through a lot\ntoday so so to quickly recap first the\nprojects feature lets us manage context\nat both the project and chat level\nenabling us to generate highly tailored\ncontent while maintaining perfect\nconsistency second Claud excels at\nturning complex information into\ninteractive dashboards via its artifacts\nfeature and the best part is we're able\nto easily make adjustments even if we\ndon't know how to code and finally\nthanks to the analysis feature clot is\nable to visualize insights derived from\nunstructured data\nin ways that anyone can understand from\nsimple funnels to customer segmentation\nanalysis if you enjoyed this you might\nwant to check out my perplexity and\nnotebook LM tutorials next see you on\nthe next video in the\nmeantime have a great one - und du kannst das auch!\n\n**Warum es funktioniert:** Dieser Trick funktioniert, weil
