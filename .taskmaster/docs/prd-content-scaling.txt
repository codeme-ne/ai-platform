# Product Requirements Document: AI Tricks Content Scaling System

## Executive Summary
Build a programmatic content generation system that creates 1,000+ high-quality AI tricks at scale by combining thegrowthlist.co's proven content psychology with template-based automation techniques used by Zapier (50,000+ pages) and TripAdvisor.

## Problem Statement
Current content creation is manual and slow (2-3 tricks per week). To compete with established platforms like thegrowthlist.co, we need to scale content production to 50+ high-quality tricks per week while maintaining engagement metrics (3+ minutes time on page, 15%+ implementation rate).

## Solution Overview
Implement a template + variables system that generates unique, valuable AI trick content at scale. Use Firecrawl for competitive intelligence, GPT-4 for content generation, and programmatic SEO techniques for targeting long-tail keywords.

- Opening hook using relatable human moments (thegrowthlist.co pattern)
- Clear psychological explanation of why technique works
- 8-12 specific implementation steps
- 5-8 real-world examples with metrics
- German language with natural, conversational tone
- Time on page target: 3+ minutes
- Implementation rate target: 15%+ of readers

### Template Architecture
