# Task ID: 12
# Title: Clean Up UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove UI elements and logic related to dropped fields from React components
# Details:
Update React components using latest React 18.2+ best practices:
1. Remove role badge from:
   - src/components/enhanced/RefinedTrickCard.tsx
   - src/components/molecules/TrickCard.tsx
2. Remove any filters/sorts using dropped fields
3. Update component props types
4. Use React.memo() for optimized rendering
5. Implement proper error boundaries

Example component update:
```typescript
import { type Database } from '@/lib/supabase/types'

type TrickCardProps = {
  trick: Database['public']['Tables']['ki_tricks']['Row']
}

export const TrickCard = React.memo(({ trick }: TrickCardProps) => {
  // Updated implementation without removed fields
});
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Write Jest/React Testing Library tests for updated components
2. Verify no references to removed fields in rendered output
3. Test component rendering with minimal schema data
4. Visual regression testing
5. Test responsive behavior

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify and Remove UI Elements Tied to Dropped Fields [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all relevant React components and remove UI elements (such as role badges) and logic that reference dropped fields, including filters and sorts.
### Details:
Focus on src/components/enhanced/RefinedTrickCard.tsx and src/components/molecules/TrickCard.tsx. Ensure no visual or logical references to dropped fields remain.

## 2. Update Component Props and Types [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Revise component prop definitions and TypeScript types to reflect the removal of dropped fields, ensuring type safety and alignment with the updated schema.
### Details:
Update all affected components to use the correct prop types. Remove any props related to dropped fields and validate with TypeScript.

## 3. Refactor Logic for Optimized Rendering and Error Boundaries [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Implement React.memo() for components where appropriate and add error boundaries to handle runtime errors gracefully, following React 18.2+ best practices.
### Details:
Apply React.memo() to functional components for performance optimization. Integrate error boundary components to catch and display errors in the UI.

## 4. Write and Update Component Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Develop and update Jest/React Testing Library tests to verify that components render correctly without dropped fields and maintain expected behavior.
### Details:
Ensure tests cover removal of dropped fields, correct rendering, error boundary functionality, and visual regression. Test with minimal schema data and responsive layouts.
