# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Enhanced Card Design System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive card component system with multiple variants (compact, feature, hero), optimized heights, professional shadows, gradients, and responsive animations while ensuring mobile compatibility.
# Details:
1. Create base card component with shared styles:
- Reduce card height from 260px to 180px
- Implement shadow system using CSS variables:
```css
--card-shadow-sm: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
--card-shadow-md: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);
--card-shadow-lg: 0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.14);
```
- Define gradient system:
```css
--card-gradient-primary: linear-gradient(145deg, var(--color-bg-primary), var(--color-bg-secondary));
--card-gradient-feature: linear-gradient(165deg, var(--color-accent-light), var(--color-accent));
```

2. Implement card variants:
- Compact: 180px height, minimal padding, condensed content
- Feature: 180px height, prominent imagery, gradient background
- Hero: Dynamic height, full-width imagery, enhanced typography

3. Add animation system:
```typescript
const cardAnimations = {
  hover: {
    scale: 1.02,
    transition: { duration: 0.2, ease: 'easeOut' }
  },
  tap: {
    scale: 0.98,
    transition: { duration: 0.1 }
  }
};
```

4. Implement responsive behavior:
- Stack cards vertically on mobile
- Adjust padding and margins based on viewport
- Optimize touch targets for mobile
- Implement proper aspect ratios for images

5. Enhance visual hierarchy:
- Define consistent spacing system
- Implement typography scale
- Create content layout templates for each variant
- Add proper content loading states

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual Testing:
- Verify card dimensions across all variants
- Validate shadow and gradient rendering
- Test animations smoothness and performance
- Check responsive behavior across breakpoints

2. Component Testing:
- Unit test component props and variants
- Test animation triggers and states
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Test touch interactions on mobile devices

3. Performance Testing:
- Measure render performance
- Test animation frame rates
- Verify memory usage
- Check bundle size impact

4. Cross-browser Testing:
- Verify rendering in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- Test gradients and shadows consistency
- Validate animations work across browsers
- Check mobile browser compatibility

5. Integration Testing:
- Test integration with data loading
- Verify card system in page layouts
- Test dynamic content rendering
- Validate responsive grid system

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Base Card Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational card component with basic styling structure and CSS variable definitions for shadows and gradients
### Details:
Create CardBase.tsx component with height of 180px. Define CSS variables for shadow system (--card-shadow-sm, --card-shadow-md, --card-shadow-lg) and gradient system (--card-gradient-primary, --card-gradient-feature). Implement basic card structure with proper HTML semantics and accessibility attributes.

## 2. Develop Card Variant Components [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Create three distinct card variants (compact, feature, hero) with specific styling and layout requirements
### Details:
Implement CompactCard.tsx (180px height, minimal padding), FeatureCard.tsx (180px height, gradient background), and HeroCard.tsx (dynamic height, full-width imagery). Each variant should extend base card component and implement specific styling requirements.

## 3. Implement Animation System [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Add smooth animations for hover and tap states using defined animation configurations
### Details:
Implement cardAnimations object with hover (scale: 1.02) and tap (scale: 0.98) states. Add animation hooks and handlers to each card variant. Ensure animations are performant using transform properties.
<info added on 2025-09-15T04:48:28.896Z>
Successfully implemented cardAnimations object with enhanced states. Added hover animation with combined scale (1.02) and translateY (-4px) transforms. Implemented tap state with scale reduction (0.98). State management now tracks isPressed and isHovered states with proper mouse and touch event handlers. Optimized performance using willChange: 'transform' property. All animations are TypeScript-compliant with proper type definitions and interfaces. Integration testing confirms smooth transitions between states with no performance degradation.

## 4. Create Mobile-Responsive Layout System [done]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement responsive behavior and mobile optimization for all card variants
### Details:
Add media queries for vertical stacking on mobile, implement touch-friendly padding (min 44px targets), optimize image aspect ratios, adjust margins based on viewport width using CSS clamp()
<info added on 2025-09-15T04:50:46.991Z>
Successfully implemented mobile-first responsive layout system with BaseCard height optimization (160px mobile, 180px+ desktop) and touch-friendly padding adjustments. Added ResponsiveImage component supporting dynamic aspect ratios and lazy loading. Integrated responsive grid utilities (card-grid-compact, card-grid-default) with CSS clamp() for fluid spacing. Mobile optimizations include touch-manipulation, select-none, and GPU acceleration. System integrates with existing mobile optimizations in globals.css, providing consistent touch targets (44px minimum), performant animations, and fluid responsive behavior across all breakpoints (320px-1024px+).
