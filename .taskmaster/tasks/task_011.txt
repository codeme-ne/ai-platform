# Task ID: 11
# Title: Update TypeScript Types
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Regenerate Supabase TypeScript types and update type references throughout the codebase
# Details:
1. Use latest Supabase CLI to regenerate types:
```bash
supabase gen types typescript --local > src/lib/supabase/types.ts
```
2. Update Database interface usage in services
3. Remove type references to dropped columns
4. Update any type guards or type assertions
5. Use TypeScript 5.3+ features for better type safety

Key files to update:
- src/lib/supabase/types.ts
- src/services/TricksService.ts
- Any components using Database types

# Test Strategy:
1. Run TypeScript compiler (tsc) to check for type errors
2. Verify no references to removed fields exist
3. Test type inference in IDE
4. Run existing type tests if present

# Subtasks:
## 1. Regenerate Supabase TypeScript Types [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Use the latest Supabase CLI to regenerate TypeScript types based on the current database schema.
### Details:
Run the command `supabase gen types typescript --local > src/lib/supabase/types.ts` to generate updated types. Ensure the CLI is authenticated and initialized for the project.

## 2. Audit and Update Type References in Services and Components [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Review all usages of the Database interface and Supabase types in services and components, updating references to match the regenerated types.
### Details:
Search for all imports and usages of Database types in files such as src/services/TricksService.ts and relevant components. Update type annotations and usages to reflect any schema changes.

## 3. Remove Obsolete Type Guards and Assertions [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Identify and remove type guards, assertions, and references related to dropped columns or outdated schema fields.
### Details:
Locate any type guards or assertions that reference fields no longer present in the regenerated types. Refactor or remove these checks to prevent type errors and maintain code clarity.

## 4. Refactor for TypeScript 5.3+ Features [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Update type definitions and usages to leverage new TypeScript 5.3+ features for improved type safety and maintainability.
### Details:
Apply relevant TypeScript 5.3+ features such as new type operators, satisfies, or enhanced type narrowing where applicable. Ensure codebase consistency and modern best practices.

## 5. Run and Fix Type Tests and Compiler Errors [done]
### Dependencies: 11.4
### Description: Run the TypeScript compiler and any existing type tests, resolving errors and verifying that all type references are correct and safe.
### Details:
Execute `tsc` and any type-related test suites. Address any type errors, missing references, or incorrect type assertions. Confirm that no references to removed fields remain and that type inference works as expected.
