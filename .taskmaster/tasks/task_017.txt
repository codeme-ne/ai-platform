# Task ID: 17
# Title: Production Deployment Planning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create and validate production deployment plan for schema changes
# Details:
1. Document deployment steps:
```bash
# Deployment sequence
supabase db push --linked # Push migration
supabase gen types typescript --linked # Update types
npm run build # Verify build
```

2. Create rollback plan:
```sql
-- Rollback script template
BEGIN;
  -- Restore columns if needed
  ALTER TABLE public.ki_tricks
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ...
  -- Restore indexes
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS ...
COMMIT;
```

3. Prepare monitoring
4. Schedule maintenance window
5. Update documentation

# Test Strategy:
1. Test deployment in staging environment
2. Verify rollback procedure
3. Test monitoring alerts
4. Validate backup restoration
5. Performance testing post-deployment

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Deployment and Rollback Steps [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create detailed documentation for the production deployment sequence and rollback procedures for schema changes, including all CLI commands and SQL scripts.
### Details:
Include step-by-step instructions for running migrations, updating types, verifying builds, and executing rollback scripts. Ensure all commands are version-controlled and reviewed before deployment.

## 2. Prepare and Test Monitoring and Alerting [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Set up and validate monitoring and alerting systems to track deployment status, database health, and error conditions during and after deployment.

### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Verify that current backup and restoration processes are functional and up-to-date prior to deployment, ensuring data can be recovered if needed.
### Details:
Perform a backup of the production database, then test restoration in a staging environment to confirm data integrity and recovery speed.

## 5. Update Deployment and Recovery Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.4
### Description: Revise and expand documentation to reflect the latest deployment, rollback, backup, and monitoring procedures for future reference and audits.
### Details:
Ensure all steps, scripts, and contingency plans are clearly documented and accessible to the team. Include lessons learned and links to relevant resources.

## 6. Run Performance and Post-Deployment Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.4
### Description: Execute performance benchmarks and post-deployment validation tests to confirm system stability, correctness, and expected performance after schema changes.
### Details:
Run automated and manual tests, monitor system metrics, and validate that all application features function as intended. Document and address any issues found.
