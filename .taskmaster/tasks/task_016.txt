# Task ID: 16
# Title: Validate Analytics and Submissions Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure trick_analytics and trick_submissions tables continue functioning correctly
# Details:
1. Verify view_count increment function:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_view_count()
 RETURNS trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.view_count := OLD.view_count + 1;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

2. Verify analytics insertion flow
3. Test submission process
4. Validate RLS policies
5. Check foreign key constraints

# Test Strategy:
1. Test view count increment
2. Verify analytics recording
3. Test submission flow end-to-end
4. Verify RLS policies
5. Load test analytics insertion

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test view_count increment logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that the increment_view_count() trigger function correctly increments the view_count field in the trick_analytics table for each relevant event.
### Details:
Create test cases that simulate updates triggering the increment_view_count() function. Confirm that view_count increases by 1 as expected for each operation, and validate behavior for edge cases such as concurrent updates.

## 2. Verify analytics insertion and data flow [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Ensure that analytics data is correctly inserted into the trick_analytics table and that all relevant fields are populated as expected.
### Details:
Insert representative analytics records and verify that triggers, defaults, and constraints are functioning. Check for correct data propagation and integrity across related tables.

## 3. Test submission process end-to-end [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Validate the complete submission workflow for the trick_submissions table, ensuring that all triggers, constraints, and related analytics updates are executed correctly.
### Details:
Simulate user submissions, verify that records are created in trick_submissions, and confirm that any related analytics or counters are updated. Test for error handling and rollback scenarios.

## 4. Validate RLS and foreign key constraints [done]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Check that Row-Level Security (RLS) policies and foreign key constraints are correctly enforced on both trick_analytics and trick_submissions tables.
### Details:
Attempt operations as various roles/users to ensure RLS policies restrict access as intended. Test foreign key relationships for referential integrity, including insert, update, and delete operations.

## 5. Perform load and edge case testing [done]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Conduct load testing and edge case validation for analytics and submissions flows to ensure robustness and performance under stress.
### Details:
Simulate high-frequency analytics events and submissions, test for race conditions, deadlocks, and data consistency. Include edge cases such as null values, maximum field lengths, and invalid data.
