# Task ID: 9
# Title: Fix Mobile Menu Visibility and Functionality Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: The mobile navigation menu is not displaying properly despite tests passing. Menu needs complete debugging and proper implementation.
# Details:
Current issues:
1. Menu was completely invisible even though DOM elements existed
2. Tests were passing falsely - they found elements but didn't verify visibility
3. Z-index conflicts may be hiding the menu
4. Position and layout issues preventing menu from showing
5. The menu panel needs proper styling to be visible against the page

Required fixes:
1. Ensure menu is actually visible when opened (not just in DOM)
2. Fix overlay click functionality
3. Verify with VISUAL testing (screenshots)
4. Make sure menu works on actual mobile devices
5. Fix any z-index stacking issues
