# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Schema Migration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize Supabase schema by removing unused fields and implementing new structure
# Details:
1. Create migration file '20250915_minimal_schema_cleanup.sql'
2. Remove specified fields using DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS
3. Update indexes and constraints
4. Implement new schema with required fields:
   - id, title, description, category, tools[]
   - steps[], examples[], slug, why_it_works
   - status, quality_score, timestamps, view_count
5. Generate updated TypeScript types

# Test Strategy:
1. Run migration on staging environment
2. Verify data integrity
3. Test TypeScript type generation
4. Validate all queries and mutations
5. Perform backup before production migration

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Migration File and Remove Unused Fields [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize migration file and remove deprecated columns from the database schema
### Details:
Create migration file '20250915_minimal_schema_cleanup.sql' and implement DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS statements for all unused fields. Include transaction wrapping and error handling.

## 2. Implement New Schema Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add new required fields and configure appropriate data types
### Details:
Add new columns: id (UUID), title (varchar), description (text), category (varchar), tools (jsonb[]), steps (jsonb[]), examples (jsonb[]), slug (varchar), why_it_works (text), status (enum), quality_score (integer), timestamps (timestamptz), view_count (integer)
<info added on 2025-09-15T03:38:19.313Z>
Schema analysis complete. No additional schema changes required. Current implementation uses TEXT[] arrays for tools, steps, and examples instead of JSONB[] as originally specified. This is deemed more appropriate for storing simple string arrays. All required fields are present in the initial schema (20250901_initial_schema.sql) with correct data types:

- Primary fields: id (UUID), title (varchar), description (text), category (varchar)
- Array fields: tools (TEXT[]), steps (TEXT[]), examples (TEXT[])
- Additional fields: slug (varchar), why_it_works (text), status (enum)
- Metrics: quality_score (integer), view_count (integer)
- Metadata: timestamps (timestamptz)

The 20250915_minimal_schema_cleanup.sql migration has already handled cleanup tasks including removal of unused fields, NOT NULL constraints, view_count addition, index optimization, and full-text search implementation with GiST index.

## 3. Update Indexes and Constraints [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement database indexes and constraints for optimized performance
### Details:
Create indexes on frequently queried fields (slug, category, status), add unique constraints on slug, implement foreign key constraints where needed, and set up GiST index for full-text search on title and description
<info added on 2025-09-15T03:40:11.113Z>
Analysis confirms all required database optimizations are implemented in migration '20250915_minimal_schema_cleanup.sql'. Indexes cover all critical query patterns:
- Unique index on slug for fast lookups and constraint enforcement
- Category index for filtering operations
- Partial index on status for efficient status-based queries
- Descending indexes on published_at and created_at for date ordering
- GiST index supporting German-language full-text search on title and description

Constraints ensure data integrity:
- Unique slug enforcement
- Category and status enum validations via CHECK constraints
- Required field validation through NOT NULL constraints
- Referential integrity via foreign key constraints on analytics and submissions

No additional index or constraint implementations required. Migration script meets all performance optimization requirements.

## 4. Generate TypeScript Types [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create and update TypeScript type definitions for the new schema
### Details:
Use Supabase CLI to generate updated TypeScript types, create custom type definitions for complex objects, implement proper null handling, and add type guards where necessary
<info added on 2025-09-15T03:53:48.800Z>
Successfully completed TypeScript type generation and codebase updates:

1. Updated KITrick interface with schema changes:
- Converted Date objects to string timestamps (created_at, updated_at, published_at)
- Renamed 'Warum es funktioniert' field to 'why_it_works'
- Added status, quality_score, and view_count fields
- Made steps and examples arrays nullable

2. Implemented database.ts type utilities:
- Created type aliases for simplified imports
- Added runtime type guards for validation
- Built conversion functions between interfaces
- Implemented custom error classes
- Added utility functions for common operations

3. Updated all codebase references (29 files):
- Fixed timestamp field references
- Updated 'Warum es funktioniert' to 'why_it_works'
- Resolved interface conflicts in admin pages
- Updated API routes and services

4. Build verification results:
- TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
- All 153 static pages generated successfully
- No remaining type conflicts or errors

Migration workflow is ready for validation and deployment phase.

## 5. Validate Migration and Deploy [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Test migration in staging and deploy to production
### Details:
Execute migration on staging environment, verify data integrity, test all affected queries and mutations, create backup of production database, and implement deployment rollback plan
<info added on 2025-09-15T04:13:35.625Z>
Critical: System crash during previous migration attempt. Before proceeding, perform the following checks:
1. Verify current database state and transaction logs
2. Check for partial migration completion or data corruption
3. Document any successfully migrated tables and columns
4. Validate backup integrity from pre-migration state
5. Test rollback functionality to ensure clean restore point is available
6. Review migration logs to identify exact point of failure
7. Confirm all database connections are stable and properly configured
8. Verify sufficient system resources are available for migration completion

Only proceed with remaining migration steps after confirming system stability and data integrity.
